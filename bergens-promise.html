                    <p>Starting in June 2024, my role as a Software Development Intern at Bergen's Promise has provided me with a unique opportunity to develop and implement critical applications that enhance cybersecurity and streamline processes within the organization.</p>

                    <h2>Full-Stack Cybersecurity Application</h2>
                    <img src="BP (1).png" alt="PAM Solutions" class="float-right">
                    <p>I developed a comprehensive full-stack cybersecurity application using Flask, Python, and data pipelines to detect password vulnerabilities and secure sensitive information. This application significantly reduced security breaches by 30%, showcasing the effectiveness of robust cybersecurity measures.</p>

                    <h2>Process Automation and Streamlining</h2>
                    <img src="BP (2).png" alt="PAM Solutions" class="float-right">
                    <p>To enhance efficiency and ensure compliance with government-mandated recordings, I automated and streamlined multiple processes using Power BI, Power Automate, Power Flows, and Power Apps. These automations reduced manual workloads and improved data accuracy, leading to more reliable and timely reporting.</p>

                    <h2>Collaborative Security Enhancements</h2>
                    <img src="BP (3).jpg" alt="PAM Solutions" class="float-right">
                    <p>Working closely with the security department, I helped implement new security procedures based on identified vulnerabilities. These collaborative efforts significantly improved the organization's cybersecurity posture, making it more resilient against potential threats.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <img src="BP (4).jpeg" alt="PAM Solutions" class="float-right">
                    <p>My internship at Bergen's Promise has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply my technical skills to real-world challenges. The projects I've worked on have not only improved my development capabilities but also underscored the importance of proactive security measures and efficient process management in an organizational setting.</p>
